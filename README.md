# E.coli-Gene-Descriptions

propionate--CoA ligase [Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655]
This gene helps with protein coding in the propionate metabolic pathway, a series of chemical reactions that occur in E.coli. As a regulon, this substrate helps catalyze the first step of the metabolic pathway. Being a ligase, this protein binds DNA fragments together as well as repairing broken fragments and the Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand of DNA during transcription. This gene is categorized as provisional in NCBI, so is subject to changes in the identified function later on. Another process that CoA ligase is thought to have a role in is fatty acid oxidization, known to occur in the cytoplasm of the E.coli cell. 

Hsp70 family chaperone Hsc62; RpoD-binding transcription inhibitor [Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655]
The Hsp70 family chaperone Hsc62 is thought to be a splice variant, which is "active mRNA that results from cutting and resealing or a RNA transcript by precise breakage of phosphodiester bonds at the 5′ and 3′ splice sites (exon-intron junction)." According to Ensembl Genomes, this gene has matches with heat-shock proteins as well, which are produced by cells in response to exposure to severe exteral temperatures/conditions. The main function of this gene is a RpoD-binding transcription inhibitor, which makes it a gene that prevents transcription of genes into the messenger RNA by binding to DNA repressor blocks and preventing the attachment of RNA Polymerase to the promoter.
