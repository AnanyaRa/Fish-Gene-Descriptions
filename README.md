propionate--CoA ligase [Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655]:

This gene helps with protein coding in the propionate metabolic pathway, a series of chemical reactions that occur in E.coli. As a regulon, this substrate helps catalyze the first step of the metabolic pathway. Being a ligase, this protein binds DNA fragments together as well as repairing broken fragments and the Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand of DNA during transcription. This gene is categorized as provisional in NCBI, so is subject to changes in the identified function later on. Another process that CoA ligase is thought to have a role in is fatty acid oxidization, known to occur in the cytoplasm of the E.coli cell. 

Hsp70 family chaperone Hsc62; RpoD-binding transcription inhibitor [Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655]:

The Hsp70 family chaperone Hsc62 is thought to be a splice variant, which is "active mRNA that results from cutting and resealing or a RNA transcript by precise breakage of phosphodiester bonds at the 5′ and 3′ splice sites (exon-intron junction)." According to Ensembl Genomes, this gene has matches with heat-shock proteins as well, which are produced by cells in response to exposure to severe exteral temperatures/conditions. The main function of this gene is a RpoD-binding transcription inhibitor, which makes it a gene that prevents transcription of genes into the messenger RNA by binding to DNA repressor blocks and preventing the attachment of RNA Polymerase to the promoter.

DL-methionine transporter subunit [Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655]:

The DL-methionine transporter subunit transports the amino acid, Methionine around the cell as a transport protein. Methionine is an amino acid that is coded for by the A-U-G codon during translation. Being the "start" codon, a transfer RNA that reads this amino acid sequence will know that the Methionine signals the beginning of translation, and the codons after that would later be translated into more proteins for the cell to function. This gene transports Methionine to be converted to cellular metabolites, also used in more metabolic pathways. 

ATP-dependent RNA helicase [Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655]
RNA Helicase is responsible for unwinding pairs of complementary RNA strands into single strands. The product of this reaction can be applied later into gel electrophoresis, where the larger double-stranded RNA moves slower than the single strands of RNA. Technically speaking, RNA Helicase can unwind RNA strands in two ways. "The helicase might move 3′-5′ with respect to the single-stranded RNA to which it has bound, or it might move in the opposite direction (ie, 5′-3′)." (What-When-How) An ATP-dependent RNA helicase gene depends on the form of energy that many organisms convert food/external sources into through their own biological process. An ATP-dependent gene would need that energy to carry out its function. In this case, RNA helicase needs ATP energy to unwind RNA strands.
